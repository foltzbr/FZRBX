**Fake Robux Display Extension (100% Open Source)**  
A fully open source browser extension created for visual, educational, and entertainment purposes only.  
It does not generate real Robux, does not modify server data, and does not affect Roblox accounts.  
Works only in the browser by changing what is displayed on screen.

## ❌ What it does NOT do

- Does not generate Robux.
- Does not change real balances.
- Does not send data to Roblox servers.
- Does not bypass purchases or security.
- Does not work outside the browser.

## 🧠 How it works

1. A fake value is stored locally in the browser.
2. A script runs on Roblox pages.
3. The displayed Robux text is replaced.
4. The value stays fixed even after page updates.

Basically the same effect as using **Inspect Element**, but automated.

## 🧩 Extension interface

- Input field for fake value.
- **Apply** button (applies the value and saves locally).
